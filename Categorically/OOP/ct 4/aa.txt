When a single method name has alternatives implementations, it is called  overloading and when a method in child class overrides a method of parent class, it is called overriding.
1.Overloading uses compile time mechanism but overriding uses runtime mechanism.
  2.In overloading number of the parameter or the type must differ but in overriding type signature must match.
